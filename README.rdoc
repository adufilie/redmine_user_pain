= User Pain bug triage for Redmine

As advertised here : http://www.lostgarden.com/2008/05/improving-bug-triage-with-user-pain.html

It's very alpha and ugly but it works.

* Use tracker to set type of bug
* Priority, same here
* A list custom field to track likelihood
* A float custom field to keep User Pain score

For the plugin to work, likelihood and user pain must be 
the first fields in the order of custom fields.

Patchs more than welcome.
